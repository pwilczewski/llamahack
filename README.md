# Using AI agents to convert Excel spreadsheets into Python code
Many institutions still use Excel widely throughout their organizations. Forecasts, financial statements, business plans, pricing models, scenario analysis are often built and maintained as Excel spreadsheets. This format limits the benefits of using Generative AI. In this repo I demonstrate that Generative AI models can be used to convert Excel spreadsheets into Python code. This conversion enables organizations to unlock more benefits from Generative AI by converting legacy models and processes to Python at very low cost.

This repo contains a proof-of-concept which can be extended to a variety of use cases. First I want to extend this app to use multiple agents and a directed graph with memory via LangGraph. Each agent could handle different aspects of the spreadsheet, allowing for more stability with largest spreadsheets. Next I want to extend this app to create databases for larger data sets rather than assigning a variable to each datum. Finally I want to extend this app to augment the Python code as needed and write it back to Excel. This feature would provide interoperability between Excel and Python allowing for business users and developers to collaborate more closely.
